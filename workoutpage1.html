        <h2>Push-Ups</h2>
        <p>
            Push-ups are a great upper body exercise that target the chest, shoulders, and triceps. 
            Start in a plank position with your arms straight, then lower your body until your chest 
            is close to the ground. Push back up to the starting position.

            lower your body by bending your knees and pushing your hips back as if sitting in a chair.

            weight supported on your forearms. Keep your body in a straight line from head to heels 
            and hold this position.

            angle. Return to the starting position and repeat with the other leg.

Step forward with one leg and lower your body until both knees are bent at a 90-degree angle. Push back up to the starting position and repeat with the other leg.
